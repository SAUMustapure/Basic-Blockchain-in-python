# Basic-Blockchain-in-python
This code is a basic implementation of how a block chain data structure works. 
The blockchain starts with a genesis block, created using predefined data.

When a new block is added:

The hash of the last block is retrieved.

A new hash is generated based on the new block's data and the previous hash.

The new block is appended to the chain.

Each blockâ€™s integrity can be verified using the hashes, ensuring data has not been tampered with.
